## Abstract
With the advancement of machine learning technologies most of our household items are becoming smart devices leading towards smart houses and smart cities. Takings steps forward, we investigate how these cutting-edge technologies can be used to make lives easier for patients and elderly people. Eight sensors have been recorded the movement of a house where a patient live with a caregiver through out a period of a year. These data were then analyzed with two different experiments, one with data through out the year and the second with data from one month. Experiment 1 used decision trees to make predictions for the sleeping behaviour and it produces a maximum test accuracy of 66.63%. However, the experiment two produces a highest test accuracy of 81.3% from both Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms. Even though we used Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks to see the ability of improving the accuracy, we observed no further improvements. Being able to predict the sleeping pattern of a patient who has irregular sleeping behaviour with over 81% is quite promising and these algorithms can be further developed to embed in smart devices in houses to make detect any abnormalities in the sleeping behaviour and trigger an alarm for the caregivers.
